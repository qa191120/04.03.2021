create a list of numbers with duplication of items
{ 3, 5, 3, 3, 8, 12, 12, 15, 3 }
  0  1  2  3  4   5   6   7  8
1. create a function which gets this list
  and a number (i.e. 12) find the last index of this number in the list
  i.e. here will return 6
2. create a function which gets this list
  and a number (i.e. 3) and returns a list of indexes with this number
  i.e. here will return { 0, 2, 3, 8 }
